Socket Programming: communication between two or more applications running on separate JRE's is Socket Programming.

1) Port:
    Port number is a logical construct. It operates on Transport layer
    It is used to uniquely identify a process for an application.
    It is a 16-bit integer ranging from 0-65535

    Port Number are divided into 3 types:
        a)Well Known Ports: 1-1023. Eg: http(80), https(443)
        b)Register Port: 1024-4951. Eg: mysql-3306
        c)Dynamic Port: 4952-65535. Used for client applications.

2) Socket:
    It is the end point of communication. 
    It creates a two way communication for data transfer.
    Operates on Applicaton layer
    Consists of ip address and port number.

3)IP Address:
    Represents address of computing device in a network.
    There are 2 types of IP addresses: IPV4(32bit) & IPV6(128bit)

4) URL:
    Address of resource in a network

5) Protocol: 
    Set of rules for communication

6) URL Class:
    It is a part of java.net package used to process URL.

    Methods
    a)public String getProtocol(); // returns protocol specified in URL
    URL_Processing.java

7)URLConnection Class:
    Used to read/write data into URL.

8)INETAddress Class:
    It is a class used to work with IP address. It has 2 sub-classes: INET4 and INET6 addresses which work with IPV4 and IPV6 respectively.
